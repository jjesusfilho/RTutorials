## Style Guide

![style](https://media1.giphy.com/media/LN6AfV6TxxJtu/giphy.gif?response_id=595fef0631e28fe288ece974)  


## Space: New lines and tabs
- Start a new line for each new thing in a mutate statement
- Start a new line generally when the line is too long. 
- Tab over inside a pipe
- Start a new code group (ie. ```{r}) when you start a new task

## Space
- Put spaces around your puncuation this allows the eye to see what's happening

```{r}
# Good 
x <- 42 + 7

# Bad
x<-42+7
```


## Naming conventions 
### i.e columns, functions, varibles... etc

- Use `snake_case` to stay consistent with tidyverse best practices
  - Lots of other R users prefer `sep.case`, but I think we should be consistent from here on out
- In general: lower case with a seperator between words
- Try not to call your data frames `df` or `data` (bad Erin)

## Puncuation

Use ", not ', for quoting text. The only exception is when the text already contains double quotes and no single quotes.

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
# Good
"Text"
'Text with "quotes"'

# Bad
'Text'
```
  
## Assignment

Use `<-` not `=` for assignment

I know it takes some time to get used to, but it makes your code look much cleaner. 

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
# Good
x <- 42

# Bad
x = 42

# Really bad
x=42
```
